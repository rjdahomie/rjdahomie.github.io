            <b>+ Infinite Wordle </b> <br>
            Used React and React Hooks (UseState, UseEffect) to recreate the popular game 
            of Wordle with a small twist of having infinitely many games in one day. This project 
            had many aspects such as state management, UseContext, Context API, and React/Javascript 
            Logic. 
            <br>

            <br>

            <b>+ Task Scheduler </b> <br>
            Worked with a team as a scrum master to develop a task scheduler in an object 
            oriented design fashion using C++. Held daily stand ups, weekly scrum meetings, 
            and frequent 1-on-1 meetings with peers to discuss improving solutions, 
            improvements of workflow, and short-term and long-term development goals. 
            Consistently tested new components using GoogleTest. Used design patterns to 
            allow extension for future versions of the project and wrote documentation for 
            each component. <br>

            <b>+ Personal Website </b> <br>
            The website you are on right now! More components are to be added to 
            this website as I progress through my career. <br>

            <b>+ DNA Sequence Similarity Checker </b> <br>
            This C++ terminal based program finds similarity between biological sequences. The 
            program compares nucleotide or protein sequences and calculates a score based on the 
            similarity of the DNA strands using Dynamic Progreaming. This task would normally 
            take hours based on the DNA strand length. However this program reduces that time 
            to seconds, a 99% decrease. <br>

            <b>+ Covid-19 Screener</b> <br>
            Developed a COVID-19 questionnaire screening tool website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
            intended to monitor student health statuses in educational establishments. This project 
            was for CutieHack Hackathon. <br>
            <br>
            
            <b>+ Prosthetic Hand</b> <br>
            Team leader of a year-long  prosthetic hand project for the PLTW Engineering Design and Development. 
            Engineered a prosthetic hand from scratch efficient enough to our evaluations and standards 
            to adequately support an individual with a hand disability. This project included 3D modeling 
            using Autodesk Inventor, 3D printing, and Java coding. This project was awarded by the Orange 
            County Uplift Foundation.
